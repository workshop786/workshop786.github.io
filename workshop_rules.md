Use of any power tool requires wearing eye protection (goggles)

Keep the workshop clean - tidy up after yourself.

Categories of 'stuff' in the workshop
=====================================

* tools - cost more, but should last a long time
* materials - things we make into other things
* fixings - consumables that we use to make materials into other things

Know which is which; where to find things, where to put things.
