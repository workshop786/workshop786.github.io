Had our first test batch of students today.

Tried something basic, but useful - made a screwdriver rack to help
clear off the tools that have been cluttering up one of the woodworking
benches.

Used some scrap/offcuts of timber we practised cross cutting to length.

Did this using the bench vise; it would have been easier with a
[Bench Hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_hook)
but didn't have one (Update: I found a basic one in the scraps box - now
am storing it under the woodworking bench. Also put a bit of primer paint
on it to hopefully mark it as a tool and not just scrap wood.)

Tried to encourage using the full length of the saw,
but this evidently takes quite a lot of practise.

Made use of the drill press to make butt joints - made a rectangular
frame then drilled some holes suitably sized and spaced to fit the
random collection of screwdrivers that were cluttering up the work
surfaces.

Here's the finished rack:

And the rack in situ:

There are also a number of short stubby screwdrivers that could fit into
the space at the bottom right of this rack... a future project.

Thinking about skills and experience of this project:
* measuring and marking timber to length
* using a square to mark guide lines around the timber
* getting a saw cut started (in the right place)
* sawing and keeping square
* marking for drilling (we didn't centre punch)
* adjusting table height on the drill press
* safety glasses around power tools
* turning the drill press on, off
* holding the work, using the levers to move the drill press down

An observation: the student found it awkward to move the drill head down
to the desired depth. 
I normally fudge this action without realising it - I wonder what is a good
technique here?
