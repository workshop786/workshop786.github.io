Did some more workshop cleaning and organising.

Sorted a bunch of screws and nails into the wall mounted storage bins;
there's a long way to go but little and often seems to be the way.

Used the cleaners vacuum cleaner to help pick up sawdust from several
places - we really need our own dust collection/vacuum solution but this
will have to do for now.

Woodworking Benches
-------------------

Had moved a bunch of tools that were being stored on the work surfaces
onto a workbench last week
([Always Be Knolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-CTkbHnpNQ))
but now the workbench became the storage location for these tools.

Put the bench dogs and pegs into the drawers at the front of each bench as
they are part of the bench tooling.

Put the rolls of tape onto the shelf with the planes on - will need to make
a dispenser rack for tape and rolls.

Had first student visit, so built a screwdriver rack - will show in another 
post.

The tool wells collect all kinds of crap if you're not careful, 
so sorted through this lot and hoovered out all the dust.


Gave the sliding mitre saw a quick hoover.
This isn't fixed to the surface yet, and has no real dust control so I
haven't tested it yet.

The shelves in that unit are interesting; they're the right size for the
plastic trays but there aren't many about.
Most have wooden shelves in, though these are a little on the thick side
so don't move in and out easily.

It would be good to box the shelves so this unit becomes a chest of drawers.
There is a lot of weight, which it is sturdy enough to take, but the lack of
drawer 'walls' means the space isn't best utilised.

Tools are:
* Files and rasps (not in very good condition)
* Chisels (salvageable, but nowhere near sharp yet)
* Multimeter (not yet tested)
* Sharpening stone (basic 80 grit?)
* etc. will need to review further
