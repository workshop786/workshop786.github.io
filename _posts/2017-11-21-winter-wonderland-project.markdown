Our first collaborative project is a model of a winter wonderland themepark.

The idea is to make a model of a winter fairground that typically pops up
around the December festive season.
Just like the
[Hyde Park Winter Wonderland Park](http://hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/)
that opens from the middle of November 2017.

A key feature of the park is the 
[Giant Observation Wheel](http://hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/attraction/thegiantobservationwheel/) which is commonly known as a
[big wheel or Ferris Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_wheel).

We plan to make a model of this!

The wheel this year is 60 metres high.
We will use 1 cm for each metre, so make our wheel 60cm high (600mm).

If we make the people to scale they will only be about 20mm high which is quite small, so we will make our people about 50mm high.
We will also have far fewer 'cars' - the little rooms that people can sit in,
and we will make them _old school_ so they are just wooden seats to sit on 
instead of being fully enclosed rooms.

We hope to motorise our wheel (with a speed control) so we can start, stop,
speed up and slow down our ride.

Also in the model we want to have stalls and other activities that mirror
the entertainments available at the real Winter Wonderland park.

Check back for updates in a week or so to see how we are getting on!
