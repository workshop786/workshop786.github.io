Thoughts about parts we need
============================

We need to make a big wheel.

We will base this around a spindle - so need to find something suitable.
There are some clothing rail offcuts in the workshop so we can use one of
these for now unless it proves unsuitable.

We could make two big discs as the sides of the wheel (MDF or plywood),
but these would be rather heavy and unsightly so we'll make a more attractive
spoked wheel,
a bit like this:

For this we will need two flat plates - as round as possible given the
facilities we have available.
We will have to drill a centre,
mark the circumference
and cut out the circle with a 
[fretsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fretsaw)
or a 
[power jigsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(power_tool))

We will mark the positions for the spokes before drilling the centre - we
have to decide how many spokes to have.
16 is a good target as the marking out just needs to be halving each time.

We may be able to use readily available materials as the spokes (something
like chopsticks if they are long enough)
otherwise we can cut square sections of wood.

The spokes need to be glued to the hub discs.
We may need to make and glue spacers too for added strength.

The rim of the wheel doesn't need to be round - we can just connect it with
straight pieces of wood.
These will hold the spokes at the right spacing.

We will make two spoked wheels so will have a left side and a right side.
It's important that these are as flat as possible.

Between each wheel (at the end of each spoke) we will have a metal rod (made
from a suitably long nail).
On these rods (which we will call cross-members) we will hang some wooden 
seats that will allow characters to ride on the big wheel.


Supporting the wheel
--------------------

The wheel needs to have supports on each side to hold it up off the base.
These can be made from MDF cut into an attractive shape.

They are like the front fork of a bicycle.

The supports can be fixed to a 'pillow block' which will hold them the right
distance apart and allow the support structure to be fixed to the base.


The base of our model
---------------------

We want to be able to carrry the model to and from the workshop to various
places; 
we expect it to live in the main hall around the Christmas period.
